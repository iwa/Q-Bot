## How to contribute

#### 1. Make a fork and clone it
#### 2. Make your modifications on the `master` branch
#### 3. Create a Merge Request, with `dev` as target branch

## How to keep your fork up to date

#### 1. Add remote from original repository in your forked repository:

    cd into/cloned/fork-repo
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/iwa/Q-Bot.git
    git fetch upstream

#### 2. Updating your fork from original repo to keep up with their changes:

    git pull upstream master

Now you should have at least 2 remotes : origin & upstream

Keep upstream/master always unedited since it'll be your fresh copy from the original repo.

**A good way to keep working on your fork for MR is :**

- Always check for an update of the upstream before begin your work
- Create another branch from upstream/master so you can keep upstream/master clean
- Make your own edits
- Create a PR
